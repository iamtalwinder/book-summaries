# Believe You Can Succeed and You Will

1. Think success, don't think failure. At work, in your home,
   substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you
   face a difficult situation, think, ''I'll win," not 'I'll probably
   lose." When you compete with someone else, think, "I'm
   equal to the best," not "I'm outclassed." When opportunity
   appears, think "I can do it," never "I can't." Let the master
   thought "I will succeed" dominate your thinking process.
   Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that
   produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite.
   Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts
   that produce failure.

2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think
   you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does
   not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical
   about success. And success isn't based on luck. Successful
   people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief
   in themselves and what they do. Never-yes, never-sell
   yourself short.

3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the
   size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements.
   Think big goals and win big success. Remember
   this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier--certainly
   no more difficult-than small ideas and small plans.
