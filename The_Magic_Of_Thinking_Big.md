# Believe You Can Succeed and You Will

1. Think success, don't think failure. At work, in your home,
   substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you
   face a difficult situation, think, ''I'll win," not 'I'll probably
   lose." When you compete with someone else, think, "I'm
   equal to the best," not "I'm outclassed." When opportunity
   appears, think "I can do it," never "I can't." Let the master
   thought "I will succeed" dominate your thinking process.
   Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that
   produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite.
   Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts
   that produce failure.

2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think
   you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does
   not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical
   about success. And success isn't based on luck. Successful
   people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief
   in themselves and what they do. Never-yes, never-sell
   yourself short.

3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the
   size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements.
   Think big goals and win big success. Remember
   this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier--certainly
   no more difficult-than small ideas and small plans.

# Cure Yourself of Excusitis, the Failure Disease

## "But My Health Isn't Good."

- "Bad" health, in a thousand different forms, is used as an
  excuse for failing to do what a person wants to do, failing to
  accept greater responsibilities, failing to make more money, failing to achieve success.

- Perfect specimen of adult life is nonexistent. There is something physically
  wrong with everybody. Many surrender in whole or in part to
  health excusitis, but success-thinking people do not.

### Four Things You Can Do to cure Health Excusitis

1. Refuse to talk about your health. The more you talk about
   an ailment, even the common cold, the worse it seems to
   get. Talking about bad health is like putting fertilizer on
   weeds. Besides, talking about your health is a bad habit.
   It bores people. It makes one appear self-centered and
   old-maidish. Success-minded people defeat the natural
   tendency to talk about their "bad" health. One may (and ,
   let me emphasize the word may) get a little sympathy, but
   one doesn't get respect and loyalty by being a chronic
   complainer.

2. Refuse to worry about your health. Dr. Walter Alvarez,
   emeritus consultant to the world-famous Mayo Clinic,
   wrote recehtly, "I always beg worriers to exercise some self-control.
   For instance, when I saw this man (a fellow who was convinced he had a diseased
   gallbladder although eight separate X-ray examinations showed that the organ was
   perfectly normal), I begged him to quit getting his gallbladder X-rayed. I have
   begged hundreds of heart-conscious men to quit getting electrocardiograms made."

3. Be genuinely grateful that your health is as good as it is.
   There's an old saying worth repeating often: "I felt sorry for
   myself because I had ragged shoes until I met a man who had
   no feet." Instead of complaining about "not feeling good,"
   it's far better to be glad you are as healthy as you are. Just
   being grateful for the health you have is powerful vaccination
   against developing new aches and pains and real illness.

4. Remind yourself often, "It's better to wear out than rust
   out." Life is yours to enjoy. Don't waste it. Don't pass up
   living by thinking yourself into a hospital bed.

## "But You've Got to Have Brains to Succeed."

- The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than
  how much intelligence you may have

### Three Ways to Cure Intelligence Excusitis

1. Never underestimate your own intelligence, and never
   overestimate the intelligence of others. Don't sell yourself
   short. Concentrate on your assets. Discover your superior
   talents. Remember, it's not how many brains you've got
   that matters. Rather, it's how you use your brains that
   counts. Manage your brains instead of worrying about how
   much IQ you've got.

2. Remind yourself several times daily, "My attitudes are more
   important than my intelligence." At work and at home
   practice positive attitudes. See the reasons why you can do
   it, not the reasons why you can't. Develop an "I'm winning"
   attitude. Put your intelligence to creative positive use. Use it
   to find ways to win, not to prove you will lose.

3. Remember that the ability to think is of much greater
   value than the ability to memorize facts. Use your mind
   to create and develop ideas, to find new and better ways,
   to do things. Ask yourself, 'Am I using my mental ability
   to make history, or am I using it merely to record history
   made by others?"

## "It's No Use. I'm Too Old (or Too Young)."

- This excuse has closed the door of real opportunity to thousands of individuals.
  They think their age is wrong, so they don't even bother to try.

### How to Handle Age Excusitis

1. Look at your present age positively. Think, 'I'm still
   young," not 'I'm already old." Practice looking forward to new
   horizons and gain the enthusiasm and the feel of youth.

2. Compute how much productive time you have left.
   Remember, a person age thirty still has 80 percent of his productive life ahead of him. And the fifty-year-old still has a big 40 percent-the best 40 percent of his opportunity years left. Life
   is actually longer than most people think!

3. Invest future time in doing what you really want to do.
   It's too late only when you let your mind go negative and think
   it's too late. Stop thinking "I should have started years ago."
   That's failure thinking. Instead think, 'I'm going to start now,
   my best years are ahead of me." That's the way successful people
   think.

## "But My Case Is Different; I Attract Bad Lucie."

- There is a cause for everything.
  Nothing happens without a cause. There is nothing accidental
  about the weather outside today. It is the result of specific causes.
  And there is no reason to believe that human affairs are an exception.

### Conquer Luck Excusitis in Two Ways

1. Accept the law of canse and effect. Take a second look at
   what appears to be someone's "good luck." You'll find that
   not luck but preparation, planning, and success-producing
   thinking preceded his good fortune. Take a second look at
   what appears to be someone's "bad luck." Look, and you'll
   discover certain specific reasons. Mr. Success receives a setback;
   he learns and profits, But when Mr. Mediocre loses, he fails to learn.

2. Don't be a wishful thinker. Don't waste your mental muscles dreaming of an
   effortless way to win success. We don't
   become successful simply through luck. Success comes
   from doing those things and mastering those principles
   that produce success. Don't count on luck for promotions,
   victories, the good things in life. Luck simply isn't designed
   to deliver these good things. Instead, just concentrate on
   developing those qualities in yourself that will make you a
   winner.

# Build Confidence and Destroy Fear

1. Action cures fear. Isolate your fear and then take
   constructive action. Inaction-doing nothing about a
   situation strengthens fear and destroys confidence.

2. Make a supreme effort to put only positive thoughts in
   your memory bank. Don't let negative, self-deprecatory
   thoughts grow into mental monsters. Simply refuse to
   recall unpleasant events or situations.

3. Put people in proper perspective. Remember, people are
   more alike, much more alike, than they are different. Get a
   balanced view of the other fellow. He is just another human
   being. And develop an understanding attitude. Many people
   will bark, but it's a rare one who bites.

4. Practice doing what your conscience tells you is right. This
   prevents a poisonous guilt complex from developing. Doing
   what's right is a very practical rule for success.

5. Make everything about you say, "I'm confident, really confident.
   "Practice these little technIques in your day-to-day
   activities:
   - Be a front seater.
   - Make eye contact.
   - Walk 25 percent faster.
   - Speak up.
   - Smile big.

# How to Think Big

1. Don't sell yourself short. Conquer the crime of self-deprecation.
   Concentrate on your assets. You're better than you think you are.

2. Use the big thinker's vocabulary. Use big. bright, cheerful
   words. Use words that promise victory; hope, happiness, .
   pleasure; avoid words that create unpleasant images of failure,
   defeat, grief.

3. Stretch your vision: See what can be, not just what is.
   Practice adding value to things, to people, and to yourself.

4. Get the big view of your job. Think, really think your present
   job is important. That next promotion depends mostly on how you think
   toward your present job.

5. Think above trivial things. Focus your attention on big
   objectives. Before getting involved in a petty matter, ask
   yourself, "Is it really important?"

# How to Think and Dream Creatively

1. Believe it tan be done. When you believe something can
   be done, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a
   solution paves the way to solution.
   Eliminate "impossible," '\won't work, "can't do," no
   use trying" from your thinking and speaking vocabulalies.

2. Don't let tradition paralyze your mind. Be receptive to new
   ideas. Be experimental. Try new approaches. Be progressive
   . in everything you do.

3. Ask yourself daily, "How can I do better?" There is no limit
   to self improvement. When you ask yourself, "How can I do
   better?" sound answers will appear. Try it and see.

4. Ask yourself, "How can I do more?" Capacity is a state
   of mind. Asking yourself this question puts your mind to
   work to find intelligent shortcuts. The success combination
   in business is: Do what you do better (improve the quality
   of your output), and: Do more of what you do (increase the
   quantity of your output).

5. Practice asking and listening. Ask and listen, and you'll obtain
   raw material for reaching sound decisions. Remember: Big
   people monopolize the listening; small people monopolize
   the talking.

6. Stretch your mind. Get stimulated. Associate with people
   who can help you think of new ideas, new ways of doing
   things. Mix with people of different occupational and social
   interests.

# You Are What You Think You Are

1. Look important; it helps you think important. Your appearance talks to you. Be sure
   it lifts your spirits and builds your confidence. Your appearance talks to others.
   Make certain it says. "Here is an important person: intelligent. prosperous. and dependable."

2. Think your work is important. Think this way; and you will
   receive mental signals on how to do your job better. Think
   your work is important, and your subordinates will think
   their work is important too.

3. Give yourself a pep talk several times daily. Build a "sellyourself-to-yourself" commercial.
   Remind yourself at every opportunity that you're a first-class person.

4. In all of life's situations, ask yourself, "Is this the way an
   important person thinks?" Then obey the answer.

# Manage Your EnvironmeHt: Go First Class

1. Be environment-conscious. Just as body diet ,makes the
   body, mind diet makes the mind.

2. Make your environment work for you, not against you.
   Don't let suppressive forces-the negative, you-can't-do-it
   people-make you think defeat.

3. Don't let small-thinking people hold you back. Jealous
   people want to see you stumble. Don't give them that satisfaction.

4. Get your advice from successful people. Your future is
   important. Never risk it with freelance advisors who are
   living failures.

5. Get plenty of psychological sunshine. Circulate in new
   groups. Discover new and stimulating things to do.

6. Throw thought poison out of your environment. Avoid
   gossip. Talk about people, but stay on the positive side.

7. Go fIrst class in everything you do. You can't afford to go
   any other way.

# Make Your Attitudes Your Allies

1. Grow the "'I'm activated" attitude. Results come in proportion to the enthusiasm invested.
   Three things to do to activate yourself are:

   Dig into it deeper. When you find yourself uninterested in something, dig in and learn more
   about it. This sets off enthusiasm.

   Life up everything about you: your smile, your
   handshake, your talk, even your walk. Act
   alive.

   Broadcast good news. No one ever accomplished
   anything positive telling bad news.

2. Grow the "You are important" attitude. People do more for
   you when you make them feel important. Remember to do
   these things:

   Show appreciation at every opportunity. Make
   people feel important.
   Call people by name.

3. Grow the "Service first" attitude, and watch money take
   care of itself. Make it a rule in everything you do: give
   people more than they expect to get.
